  text: Dr Gologorsky is the best ophthalmologist I have ever been to! He is very  thorough
    during all my eye examinations, leaving nothing to chance.  He takes his time
    without being rushed and answers all my questions.  My experience was the best
    it could have ever been and I highly recommend him! Oh - and I want to mention
    that during COVID I was especially satisfied and calmed as his office was extremely
    clean, staff was very professional and scheduled me with no wait time.
