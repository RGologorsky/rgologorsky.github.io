  text: Dr. Gologorsy has been a blessing to me during a frightening and painful time.
    He first treated me for a massive retinal tear through the ER at Bascon Palmer.
    I now see a specialist, but Dr. Gologorky has followed my case and has answered
    my many questions with great patience for over a year. He is clearly a gifted physician 
    and scholar. He is also devoted to his patients and generous with his knowledge and time.
